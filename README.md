# Crypto-Trade

App created for JS Back-End exam at SoftUni.

## Overview

The visitors can **view** the **Home page** and **All Crypto** catalog with available offers.
They can also **register** with an **email**, **username**, and **password**, allowing them to create their offers for crypto trade and **buy crypto**(if the **current**
**user** is **not** **owner of the crypto** offer). Authors can edit or delete posts at any time.

## Technical Details

SoftUni provided the HTML and CSS.

For implementation I used:

- **Express.js** as a back-end framework.
- **MongoDB** as a database with **mongoose**
- **Express-handlebars** for view engine
- **bcrypt** for password hashing
- **JWT** for tokens.
